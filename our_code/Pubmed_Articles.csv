"Increase in efficacy of cancer radiotherapy by combination with whole-body low dose irradiation .","PURPOSE : Design of cancer radiotherapy protocol to reduce radiation dose and increase treatment efficacy in Lewis lung cancer ( LLC ) model . METHODS : C57BL/6J mice subcutaneously implanted with LLC were treated by conventional radiotherapy ( 2Gy x 6 ) combined with LDWBI ( low dose whole-body irradiation ; the second , third , fifth and sixth local doses of 2Gy each substituted by LDWBI with 0.075Gy ) and/or gene therapy ( intratumor injection of pEgr-IL-18-B7.1 plasmid 24 h before the first and fourth local doses ) . Immunologic mechanisms were explored . RESULTS : Cancer control was most significantly improved in the group receiving local radiotherapy combined with LDWBI and gene therapy as shown by prolongation of mean survival time by 60.4 % , reduction in average tumor weight by 70.8 % , decrease in pulmonary metastasis by 66.9 % and decrease in intratumor angiogenesis by 64.8 % as compared to local radiotherapy alone ( p < 0.05 ) . These changes in tumor growth and progression were accompanied with up-regulation of host immunity manifested by stimulated NK ( natural killer ) and CTL ( cytotoxic T lymphocyte ) activity , IFN ( interferon)-gamma and TNF ( tumor necrosis factor)-alpha secretion , PKC ( protein kinase C)-theta activation and LAMP ( lysosomal associated membrane protein)-1 expression . CONCLUSION : Combination of conventional radiotherapy with LDWBI and gene transfer could reduce total radiation dose by 2/3 and at the same time improve treatment efficacy of cancer accompanied with up-regulated host anticancer immunity .","International journal of radiation biology Increase in efficacy of cancer radiotherapy by combination with whole-body low dose irradiation .

"Interleukin 18 preserves a perforin-dependent graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation .","We have recently shown that early administration of interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) after bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) attenuates acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) in a lethally irradiated parent into F1 ( B6-->B6D2F1 ) BMT model . In this study , we investigated whether IL-18 can maintain graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effect in this context . B6D2F1 mice received transplants of T-cell-depleted (TCD ) bone marrow ( BM ) and splenic T cells from either syngeneic ( H2( b/d ) ) or allogeneic B6 ( H2( b ) ) donors . Recipient mice were treated with recombinant murine IL-18 or the control diluent . Initial studies demonstrated that IL-18 treatment did not affect the proliferative responses or the cytolytic effector functions of T cells after BMT. In subsequent experiments , animals also received host-type P815 mastocytoma cells at the time of BMT. All syngeneic BM transplant recipients died from leukemia by day 18 . The allogeneic BM transplant recipients effectively rejected their leukemia regardless of treatment and IL-18 significantly reduced GVHD-related mortality . Examination of the cytotoxic mechanisms with perforin-deficient donor T cells demonstrated that perforin is critical for the GVL effect . Taken together these data demonstrate that IL-18 can attenuate acute GVHD without impairing the in vitro cytolytic function or the in vivo GVL activity after allogeneic BMT.","Blood Interleukin 18 preserves a perforin-dependent graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation .

"Intensification of antitumor effect by T helper 1-dominant adoptive immunogene therapy for advanced orthotopic colon cancer .","PURPOSE : T helper ( Th ) 1/Th2 balance , controlled by Th1 or Th2 cells producing cytokines , plays important roles in antitumor immunity . Interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) can act together with IL-12 in promoting the generation of IFN-gamma producing Th1 cells . The goal of this study was to determine whether cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) secreted in a murine IL-18-induced Th1-dominant state inhibited the development of primary tumors and synchronous liver metastases in orthotopic colon cancer model . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Murine IL-18 gene was transduced into activated T lymphocytes by an adenovirus vector encoding IL-18 ( AdIL-18 ) liposome complex method . Efficacy of adoptive immunogene therapy using AdIL-18 with or without IL-12 was tested in advanced orthotopic xenograft of murine colon cancer . To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the adoptive immunogene therapy , serum IL-4 , IL-6 , IFN-gamma , and tumor necrosis factor alpha production in Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and quantification of tumor vascularity were investigated . RESULTS : By a modified method of adenoviral gene transduction , T lymphocytes achieved efficient IL-18 production without cell toxicity . Against orthotopic colon cancer , when combined with low dose of recombinant ( r ) IL-12 ( AdIL-18-CTL/rIL-12 ) , the therapeutic efficacy showed much smaller tumors with no liver metastases and no disseminated tumors . There was a significant difference in the volume of primary tumors and the number of liver metastases compared with the group treated with AdIL-18-CTL alone or other group ( P < 0.01 ) . In addition , the median survival time of the group treated with AdIL-18-CTL was 53.7 +/ - 5.8 days and that of AdIL-18-CTL/rIL-12 was 78.4 +/ - 6.1 days , which was also a significant difference ( P < 0.01 ) . These antitumor mechanisms were involved with Th1-dominant response in serum Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and suppression of neovascularization at primary tumor site . CONCLUSION : These data suggest that a strategy of Th1/Th2 balance-based adoptive immunogene therapy might be useful for advanced cancer patients .","Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research Intensification of antitumor effect by T helper 1-dominant adoptive immunogene therapy for advanced orthotopic colon cancer .

The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection , especially in those with advanced disease ( CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl ) . An enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay , which detects interferon ( IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens , was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection , attending a single HIV unit .

The response of five baboons to Gag peptides in a gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay after three pTHGag immunizations ranged from 100 to 515 spot-forming units ( s .f.u. ) per 10(6 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , whilst the response of two baboons to the Gag VLP vaccine ranged from 415 to 465 s .f.u . per 10(6 ) PBMCs . An increase in the Gag-specific response to a range of 775-3583 s .f.u . per 10(6 ) PBMCs was achieved by boosting with Gag VLPs the five baboons that were primed with pTHGag .

"Induction of guanylate binding protein 5 by gamma interferon increases susceptibility to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-induced pyroptosis in RAW 264.7 cells .","The regulation of caspase-1 activation in macrophages plays a central role in host defense against bacterial pathogens . The activation of caspase-1 by the detection of bacterial products through Nod-like receptors leads to the secretion of mature interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) and IL-18 and the induction of rapid host cell death ( pyroptosis ) . Here , we report that pyroptosis induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can be positively regulated by prior gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells . This increase in cell death is dependent on both caspase-1 activation and , in part , Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) expression by Salmonella . Furthermore , the exogenous expression of the IFN-gamma-induced protein guanylate binding protein 5 ( GBP-5 ) is sufficient to induce a heightened susceptibility of RAW 264.7 cells to Salmonella-induced pyroptosis , and the endogenous expression of GBP-5 is important for this phenomenon . RAW 264.7 cells with decreased expression of GBP-5 mRNA ( inhibited by short hairpin RNA against GBP-5 ) release twofold less lactate dehydrogenase ( a marker of membrane permeability ) upon infection by invasive S. enterica serovar Typhimurium than do infected control cells .

The regulation of caspase-1 activation in macrophages plays a central role in host defense against bacterial pathogens . The activation of caspase-1 by the detection of bacterial products through Nod-like receptors leads to the secretion of mature interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) and IL-18 and the induction of rapid host cell death ( pyroptosis ) . Here , we report that pyroptosis induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can be positively regulated by prior gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells . This increase in cell death is dependent on both caspase-1 activation and , in part , Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) expression by Salmonella . Furthermore , the exogenous expression of the IFN-gamma-induced protein guanylate binding protein 5 ( GBP-5 ) is sufficient to induce a heightened susceptibility of RAW 264.7 cells to Salmonella-induced pyroptosis , and the endogenous expression of GBP-5 is important for this phenomenon . RAW 264.7 cells with decreased expression of GBP-5 mRNA ( inhibited by short hairpin RNA against GBP-5 ) release twofold less lactate dehydrogenase ( a marker of membrane permeability ) upon infection by invasive S. enterica serovar Typhimurium than do infected control cells .

"Influence of interleukin-15 on CD8+ natural killer cells in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected chimpanzees .","Chimpanzees are susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) and develop persistent infection but generally do not progress to full-blown AIDS . Several host and immunological factors have been implicated in mediating resistance to disease progression . Chimpanzees have a higher prevalence of circulating natural killer ( NK) cells than humans ; however , their role in mediating resistance to disease progression is not well understood . Furthermore , NK cell survival and activity have been shown to be dependent on interleukin-15 ( IL-15 ) . Accordingly , the influence of IL-15 on NK cell activity and gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) production was evaluated in naive and HIV-1-infected chimpanzees . In vitro stimulation of whole-blood cultures with recombinant gp120 (rgp120 ) resulted in enhanced IFN-gamma production predominantly by the CD3(-) CD8( + ) subset of NK cells , and addition of anti-IL-15 to the system decreased IFN-gamma production . Moreover , in vitro stimulation with recombinant IL-15 (rIL-15 ) augmented IFN-gamma production from this subset of NK cells and increased NK cell cytotoxic activity . Stimulation with rgp120 also resulted in a 2- to 7-fold increase in IL-15 production .

"IL-18 regulates intestinal mastocytosis and Th2 cytokine production independently of IFN-gamma during Trichinella spiralis infection .","Expulsion of the gastrointestinal nematode Trichinella spiralis is associated with pronounced mastocytosis mediated by a Th2-type response involving IL-4 , IL-10 , and IL-13 . Here we demonstrate that IL-18 is a key negative regulator of protective immune responses against T. spiralis in vivo . IL-18 knockout mice are highly resistant to T. spiralis infection , expel the worms rapidly and subsequently develop low levels of encysted muscle larvae . The increased speed of expulsion is correlated with high numbers of mucosal mast cells and an increase in IL-13 and IL-10 secretion . When normal mice were treated with rIL-18 in vivo , worm expulsion was notably delayed , and the development of mastocytosis and Th2 cytokine production was significantly reduced . The treatment had no effect on intestinal eosinophilia or goblet cell hyperplasia but specifically inhibited the development of mastocytosis .

"Bovine lactoferrin inhibits tumor-induced angiogenesis .","Recent studies have demonstrated that bovine lactoferrin ( bLF ) suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in the mouse and rat and moreover may inhibit angiogenesis . To determine whether angiogenesis inhibition might contribute to antitumor activity , we examined the influence of bLF on tumor-induced angiogenesis and endothelial cell functions as well as angiogenesis-related cytokine production . Bovine LF exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis on 4-6-day-old chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes ( CAMs) that lack a mature immune response . This inhibition was reversed when bLF was simultaneously treated with basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . It also inhibited in vitro formation of tube-like structures of mouse endothelial KOP2.16 cells . Moreover , it potently suppressed bFGF- or VEGF-induced proliferation of mouse endothelial KOP2.16 cells , but not of mouse fibroblast A31 cells and Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL ) cells .

"Rapid generation of potent and tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes by interleukin 18 using dendritic cells and natural killer cells .","We hypothesized that antitumor-specific immunity , which is induced by interleukin ( IL ) 18 treatment in murine tumor models , is promoted by enhancing natural killer ( NK)-mediated destruction of tumor and delivery to dendritic cells (DCs ) . These activated and antigen-pulsed DCs then critically and optimally induce an adoptive immune response , positioning IL-18 as an important bridge between the innate and adoptive immune response . The effect of IL-18 added to cultures of live tumor cells (MCA205 , a mouse sarcoma cell line ) , NK cells , DCs , and T cells was assessed . When recombinant ( r ) mIL-18 protein was added to this culture , potent NK cytolytic activity with subsequent generation of CTLs was observed in a dose-dependent manner . Without introduction of either rmIL-18 or NK cells into this culture , systemic cytolytic activity was significantly decreased . Following the absence of direct contact of either NK cells or DCs with other cells in this cooperative coculture system using transwell , the systemic cytolytic activity of both NK cells and CTLs was greatly suppressed . The cytolysis mediated by effector cells harvested after completion of the culture was primarily restricted to MHC class I and highly specific for the tumor cells used in the coculture . Furthermore , we examined the efficiency in the induction of cytolytic T cells of other established IFN-gamma inducing T-cell growth factors , IL-2 , and IL-12 in this culture system and compared them with that mediated by IL-18 . Neither IL-2 nor IL-12 induced tumor-specific cytolytic T cells to the same degree as that mediated by IL-18 . Efficacy of this system in induction of tumor-specific CTLs was also observed in the system using MC38 adenocarcinoma cells .

"Orally administered bovine lactoferrin induces caspase-1 and interleukin-18 in the mouse intestinal mucosa : a possible explanation for inhibition of carcinogenesis and metastasis .","We have previously demonstrated that oral administration of bovine lactoferrin ( bLF ) markedly inhibits lung metastatic colony formation , and that this inhibition was possibly due to the activation of T and NK cells . Furthermore , we found that interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) is induced in epithelial cells of the small intestine by bLF. The present study was undertaken to confirm cytokine production in response to bLF and to assess the underlying mechanisms . Markedly elevated IL-18 levels were found in the small intestine 1-3 h after a single administration of bLF , its pepsin hydrolysate ( bLFH) , or bTF. Importantly , while IL-18 was significantly increased after a regimen of seven daily administrations of bLF or bLFH , administration of bTF over the course of seven days had little or no effect . In addition to IL-18 , a significant increase in caspase-1 activity and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) was found in the small intestine after administration of bLF. Similarly , in peritoneal macrophages , bLF markedly enhanced caspase-1 activity and IL-18 levels . Finally , a caspase-1 inhibitor significantly decreased bLF mediated induction of IL-18 in vitro .

Furthermore , we found that interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) is induced in epithelial cells of the small intestine by bLF. The present study was undertaken to confirm cytokine production in response to bLF and to assess the underlying mechanisms . Markedly elevated IL-18 levels were found in the small intestine 1-3 h after a single administration of bLF , its pepsin hydrolysate ( bLFH) , or bTF. Importantly , while IL-18 was significantly increased after a regimen of seven daily administrations of bLF or bLFH , administration of bTF over the course of seven days had little or no effect . In addition to IL-18 , a significant increase in caspase-1 activity and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) was found in the small intestine after administration of bLF. Similarly , in peritoneal macrophages , bLF markedly enhanced caspase-1 activity and IL-18 levels . Finally , a caspase-1 inhibitor significantly decreased bLF mediated induction of IL-18 in vitro .

"Prevention of SIV rectal transmission and priming of T cell responses in macaques after local pre-exposure application of tenofovir gel .","BACKGROUND : The rectum is particularly vulnerable to HIV transmission having only a single protective layer of columnar epithelium overlying tissue rich in activated lymphoid cells ; thus , unprotected anal intercourse in both women and men carries a higher risk of infection than other sexual routes . In the absence of effective prophylactic vaccines , increasing attention is being given to the use of microbicides and preventative antiretroviral ( ARV ) drugs . To prevent mucosal transmission of HIV , a microbicide/ARV should ideally act locally at and near the virus portal of entry . As part of an integrated rectal microbicide development programme , we have evaluated rectal application of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT ) inhibitor tenofovir ( PMPA , 9-[( R)-2-(phosphonomethoxy ) propyl ] adenine monohydrate ) , a drug licensed for therapeutic use , for protective efficacy against rectal challenge with simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) in a well-established and standardised macaque model . METHODS AND FINDINGS : A total of 20 purpose-bred Indian rhesus macaques were used to evaluate the protective efficacy of topical tenofovir . Nine animals received 1 % tenofovir gel per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge , four macaques received placebo gel , and four macaques remained untreated . In addition , three macaques were given tenofovir gel 2 h after virus challenge . Following intrarectal instillation of 20 median rectal infectious doses ( MID50 ) of a noncloned , virulent stock of SIVmac251/32H , all animals were analysed for virus infection , by virus isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) , quantitative proviral DNA load in PBMC , plasma viral RNA (vRNA ) load by sensitive quantitative competitive (qc ) RT-PCR , and presence of SIV-specific serum antibodies by ELISA . We report here a significant protective effect ( p = 0.003 ; Fisher exact probability test ) wherein eight of nine macaques given tenofovir per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge were protected from infection ( n = 6 ) or had modified virus outcomes ( n = 2 ) , while all untreated macaques and three of four macaques given placebo gel were infected , as were two of three animals receiving tenofovir gel after challenge . Moreover , analysis of lymphoid tissues post mortem failed to reveal sequestration of SIV in the protected animals . We found a strong positive association between the concentration of tenofovir in the plasma 15 min after rectal application of gel and the degree of protection in the six animals challenged with virus at this time point . Moreover , colorectal explants from non-SIV challenged tenofovir-treated macaques were resistant to infection ex vivo , whereas no inhibition was seen in explants from the small intestine . Tissue-specific inhibition of infection was associated with the intracellular detection of tenofovir . Intriguingly , in the absence of seroconversion , Gag-specific gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma)-secreting T cells were detected in the blood of four of seven protected animals tested , with frequencies ranging from 144 spot forming cells ( SFC)/10(6 ) PBMC to 261 spot forming cells ( SFC)/10(6 ) PBMC. CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that colorectal pretreatment with ARV drugs , such as tenofovir , has potential as a clinically relevant strategy for the prevention of HIV transmission . We conclude that plasma tenofovir concentration measured 15 min after rectal administration may serve as a surrogate indicator of protective efficacy . This may prove to be useful in the design of clinical studies . Furthermore , in vitro intestinal explants served as a model for drug distribution in vivo and susceptibility to virus infection . The finding of T cell priming following exposure to virus in the absence of overt infection is provocative . Further studies would reveal if a combined modality microbicide and vaccination strategy is feasible by determining the full extent of local immune responses induced and their protective potential .","PLoS medicine Prevention of SIV rectal transmission and priming of T cell responses in macaques after local pre-exposure application of tenofovir gel .

Following intrarectal instillation of 20 median rectal infectious doses ( MID50 ) of a noncloned , virulent stock of SIVmac251/32H , all animals were analysed for virus infection , by virus isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) , quantitative proviral DNA load in PBMC , plasma viral RNA (vRNA ) load by sensitive quantitative competitive (qc ) RT-PCR , and presence of SIV-specific serum antibodies by ELISA . We report here a significant protective effect ( p = 0.003 ; Fisher exact probability test ) wherein eight of nine macaques given tenofovir per rectum up to 2 h prior to virus challenge were protected from infection ( n = 6 ) or had modified virus outcomes ( n = 2 ) , while all untreated macaques and three of four macaques given placebo gel were infected , as were two of three animals receiving tenofovir gel after challenge . Moreover , analysis of lymphoid tissues post mortem failed to reveal sequestration of SIV in the protected animals . We found a strong positive association between the concentration of tenofovir in the plasma 15 min after rectal application of gel and the degree of protection in the six animals challenged with virus at this time point . Moreover , colorectal explants from non-SIV challenged tenofovir-treated macaques were resistant to infection ex vivo , whereas no inhibition was seen in explants from the small intestine . Tissue-specific inhibition of infection was associated with the intracellular detection of tenofovir . Intriguingly , in the absence of seroconversion , Gag-specific gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma)-secreting T cells were detected in the blood of four of seven protected animals tested , with frequencies ranging from 144 spot forming cells ( SFC)/10(6 ) PBMC to 261 spot forming cells ( SFC)/10(6 ) PBMC. CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that colorectal pretreatment with ARV drugs , such as tenofovir , has potential as a clinically relevant strategy for the prevention of HIV transmission . We conclude that plasma tenofovir concentration measured 15 min after rectal administration may serve as a surrogate indicator of protective efficacy . This may prove to be useful in the design of clinical studies . Furthermore , in vitro intestinal explants served as a model for drug distribution in vivo and susceptibility to virus infection . The finding of T cell priming following exposure to virus in the absence of overt infection is provocative . Further studies would reveal if a combined modality microbicide and vaccination strategy is feasible by determining the full extent of local immune responses induced and their protective potential .","Tsuneya McGowan, Tsuneya Heeney, Tsuneya Kashuba, Tsuneya Cope, Tsuneya Ham, Tsuneya Dennis, Tsuneya Rezk, Tsuneya Herrera, Tsuneya Anton, Tsuneya Sharpe, Tsuneya Berry, Tsuneya Shattock, Tsuneya Cranage","Human-Aids","PubMed"

"Relative dominance of Env-gp41-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes responses in HIV-1 advanced infection .","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) responses provide an important defense in controlling HIV-1 replication , but they fail to control the progression of AIDS in advanced HIV-1 infection . To uncover the situation of these responses in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection , we assessed HIV-1-specific CTL responses in 20 individuals with advanced HIV-1 infection using 407 overlapping peptides spanning all expressed HIV-1 proteins using a gamma interferon-enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISpot ) assay . In comparison to 20 individuals with moderately advanced HIV-1 infection , HIV-1-specific CTL responses were significantly decreased ( P=0.044 ) and less peptides could be recognized ( P=0.05 ) in advanced HIV-1 infection . Weakening of Env-gp120 and Gag-specific CTL responses contributed importantly to the decrease of CTL magnitude ( P=0.042 and 0.078 , respectively ) , while Env-gp41-specific CTL responses were relatively stronger during the end-stage of HIV-1 infection ( P<0.001 ) . Nef and Env-gp41 represented the most frequently targeted HIV-1 proteins in advanced HIV-1 infection . The entropy scores of peptides targeted in two groups were not significantly different .

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) responses provide an important defense in controlling HIV-1 replication , but they fail to control the progression of AIDS in advanced HIV-1 infection . To uncover the situation of these responses in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection , we assessed HIV-1-specific CTL responses in 20 individuals with advanced HIV-1 infection using 407 overlapping peptides spanning all expressed HIV-1 proteins using a gamma interferon-enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISpot ) assay . In comparison to 20 individuals with moderately advanced HIV-1 infection , HIV-1-specific CTL responses were significantly decreased ( P=0.044 ) and less peptides could be recognized ( P=0.05 ) in advanced HIV-1 infection . Weakening of Env-gp120 and Gag-specific CTL responses contributed importantly to the decrease of CTL magnitude ( P=0.042 and 0.078 , respectively ) , while Env-gp41-specific CTL responses were relatively stronger during the end-stage of HIV-1 infection ( P<0.001 ) . Nef and Env-gp41 represented the most frequently targeted HIV-1 proteins in advanced HIV-1 infection . The entropy scores of peptides targeted in two groups were not significantly different .

"A centralized gene-based HIV-1 vaccine elicits broad cross-clade cellular immune responses in rhesus monkeys .","One of the major challenges that must be met in developing an HIV-1 vaccine is devising a strategy to generate cellular immunity with sufficient breadth to deal with the extraordinary genetic diversity of the virus .

It has been proposed that creating immunogens using centralized HIV-1 gene sequences might provide a practical solution to this problem . Such centralized genes can be generated by employing a number of different strategies : consensus , ancestral , or center of tree sequences . These computer-generated sequences are a shorter genetic distance from any two contemporary virus sequences than those contemporary sequences are from each other .

We show that vaccine immunogens expressing the single centralized gene CON-S generated cellular immune responses with significantly increased breadth compared with immunogens expressing a wild-type virus gene .

IL-18 is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is cleaved and activated by caspase-1/interleukin-1beta converting enzyme ( ICE) . IL-18 shares several biological properties with IL-12 , including the ability to induce IFN-gamma production in T lymphocytes and natural killer ( NK) cells .

This led us to examine the potential role of IL-18 in the pathogenesis of VSV encephalitis . We show that both IL-18 and caspase-1 mRNA are consistently present in the CNS of mice . The addition of exogenous IL-18 to cell cultures does not affect the production of VSV , and addition of exogenous IL-18 at the time of infection does not alter the morbidity or mortality of BALB/c mice .

The amount of mtDNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) was measured at baseline and at the end of HCV therapy . RESULTS : Mean baseline serum HCV-RNA was 5.8 log IU/ml and 56 % of patients were infected by HCV genotype 1 .

MATERIALS AND METHODS : Expression plasmids harboring the gene for IL-12 or IL-18 were cotransferred to subcutaneous murine CT26 tumors . Subsequent expression of IFN-gamma and the presence of CD8+ T cells within treated tumors were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS : IL-12 + IL-18 EGT inhibited tumor growth significantly better than IL-12 EGT , which was consistent with significantly higher intratumoral levels of IFN-gamma . Enhanced infiltration of tumor tissues by CD8+ T cells was confirmed with both IL-12 and IL-12 + IL-18 EGT. Finally , IL-12 + IL-18 EGT , but not IL-12 EGT , significantly suppressed untreated contralateral tumors . CONCLUSION : EGT with IL-12 and IL-18 is potentially an effective antitumor gene therapy .","Shun'ichiro Tamura, Shun'ichiro Ushio, Shun'ichiro Nishi, Shun'ichiro Sakata, Shun'ichiro Takeshima, Shun'ichiro Goto","Mouse-Cancer","PubMed"
"Critical role for Cryopyrin/Nalp3 in activation of caspase-1 in response to viral infection and double-stranded RNA .","Viral infection induces the production of interleukin ( IL)-1beta and IL-18 in macrophages through the activation of caspase-1 , but the mechanism by which host cells sense viruses to induce caspase-1 activation is unknown .

"Polymorphisms in IRF-1 associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection in highly exposed uninfected Kenyan sex workers .","OBJECTIVE : To determine the correlation between polymorphisms in the IL-4 gene cluster and resistance to HIV-1 infection . DESIGN : : A cross-sectional genetic analysis of polymorphisms within the IL-4 gene cluster was conducted in a well-described female sex worker cohort from Nairobi , Kenya , known to exhibit differential susceptibility to HIV-1 infection . METHODS : Microsatellite genotyping was used to screen six microsatellite markers in the IL-4 gene cluster for associations with HIV-1 resistance . Further analysis of the interferon regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) gene was conducted by genomic sequencing . Associations between IRF-1 gene polymorphisms and the HIV-1 resistance phenotype were determined using the chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis . The functional consequence of IRF-1 polymorphism was conducted by quantitative Western blot . RESULTS : Three polymorphisms in IRF-1 , located at 619 , the microsatellite region and 6516 of the gene , showed associations with resistance to HIV-1 infection . The 619A , 179 at IRF-1 microsatellite and 6516G alleles were associated with the HIV-1-resistant phenotype and a reduced likelihood of seroconversion . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with protective IRF-1 genotypes exhibited significantly lower basal IRF-1 expression and reduced responsiveness to exogenous IFN-gamma stimulation .

Such defects could be a direct consequence of macrophage HIV infection or secondary to reduced enhancement of macrophage effector functions by interferon-gamma ( IFNgamma ) as CD4 cell count falls . DESIGN : Ex-vivo scientific case-control study . METHODS : Primary ex-vivo human alveolar macrophages ( huAM ) from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects were challenged with Salmonella typhimurium under unprimed and IFNgamma-primed conditions to study internalization and intracellular killing of bacteria and cytokine responses of huAM. RESULTS : Priming of huAM with IFNgamma reduced bacterial internalization but enhanced microbicidal activity against intracellular salmonellae . HuAM from HIV-positive subjects showed unimpaired internalization and intracellular killing of salmonellae , with and without IFNgamma priming . Opsonic and mannose receptor ( CD206)-mediated entry was not required for optimal internalization . HuAM from HIV-positive subjects , however , exhibited increased secretion of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) , interleukin ( IL)-10 and IL-12 in response to S. typhimurium challenge , regardless of IFNgamma priming . This cytokine dysregulation showed a trend to a curvilinear relationship with peripheral CD4 cell count , with marked decline at values < 250 cell/mul . CONCLUSIONS : Dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokine release , including IL-12 , by macrophages during salmonella infection may underlie the susceptibility to severe salmonellosis in patients with AIDS . This defect was not reversed by IFNgamma and may represent a proinflammatory effect of HIV infection upon the macrophage or the alveolar milieu .","AIDS ( London , England ) Primary macrophages from HIV-infected adults show dysregulated cytokine responses to Salmonella , but normal internalization and killing .

"Oral immunization of rhesus macaques with adenoviral HIV vaccines using enteric-coated capsules .","Targeted delivery of vaccine candidates to the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract holds potential for mucosal immunization , particularly against mucosal pathogens like the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Among the different strategies for achieving targeted release in the GI tract , namely the small intestine , pH sensitive enteric coating polymers have been shown to protect solid oral dosage forms from the harsh digestive environment of the stomach and dissolve relatively rapidly in the small intestine by taking advantage of the luminal pH gradient . We developed an enteric polymethacrylate formulation for coating hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose ( HPMC) capsules containing lyophilized Adenoviral type 5 ( Ad5 ) vectors expressing HIV-1 gag and a string of six highly-conserved HIV-1 envelope peptides representing broadly cross-reactive CD4( + ) and CD8( + ) T cell epitopes . Oral immunization of rhesus macaques with these capsules primed antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses and subsequent intranasal delivery of the envelope peptide cocktail using a mutant cholera toxin adjuvant boosted cellular immune responses including , antigen-specific intracellular IFN-gamma-producing CD4( + ) and CD8( + ) effector memory T cells in the intestine . These results suggest that the combination of oral adenoviral vector priming followed by intranasal protein/peptide boosting may be an effective mucosal HIV vaccination strategy for targeting viral antigens to the GI tract and priming systemic and mucosal immunity .","Vaccine Oral immunization of rhesus macaques with adenoviral HIV vaccines using enteric-coated capsules .

"Early depletion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T helper 1 cell responses after HIV-1 infection .","BACKGROUND : The acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis is often the first manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . This study was conducted to better understand the mechanism underlying M. tuberculosis-specific pathogenicity early after onset of HIV infection . METHODS : M. tuberculosis-specific T helper 1 ( Th1 ) cells were studied in HIV negative ( n=114 ) and chronically HIV infected ( n=68 ) Tanzanian subjects by using early secreted antigenic target 6 ( ESAT6 ) protein or tuberculin ( purified protein derivative ) with interferon-gamma ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining . In a longitudinal study , the effect of acute HIV infection on M. tuberculosis-specific Th1 cells was determined by polychromatic flow cytometric analysis in 5 subjects with latent M. tuberculosis infection who became infected with HIV. RESULTS : In tuberculosis ( TB)-asymptomatic subjects ( i .e . , subjects with unknown TB status who did not show clinical signs suggestive of TB) , chronic HIV infection was associated with a decreased percentage of subjects with detectable M. tuberculosis-specific Th1 cells ( P< .001 ) a decrease which was not observed among subjects with active TB. Acute HIV infection induced a rapid depletion of M. tuberculosis-specific Th1 cells in 4 subjects remained TB asymptomatic , whereas the population of these cells remained stable in subjects who remained HIV negative ( P< .01 ) .

RESULTS : In an interferon-gamma ELISpot assay , p24 was the dominant protein targeted by B*57 carriers while responses to Nef dominated in B*35 or B*53 positive carriers . This differential protein targeting did not change during 4 years of follow-up . In these chronically infected adolescents , there were no significant differences in the quality of the immunodominant T-cell responses between the B*57 and B*35/B*53 carriers as measured by peptide avidity , degranulation , and immune memory markers . There was a trend towards higher expression of interleukin-2 from B*57-KF11 restricted CD8 T cells although this difference was not significant . Nevertheless both B*57 and B*35/53-restricted responses were relatively potent as reflected by the propensity of CD8 T cells to escape in p24 and Nef , respectively .

There is currently much interest in generating cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses against tumor antigens as a therapy for cancer . In this study mouse fibroblasts (H-2( b ) ) were genetically modified to express a costimulatory B7.1 and a mature interleukin ( IL)-18 , and then loaded with an ovalbumin ( OVA ) epitope ( SIINFEKL , H-2K( b ) restricted ) as a model antigen , and tested for the induction of OVA-specific CTLs in C57BL/6 mice (H-2( b ) ) . The genetically modified fibroblasts lacking either IL-18 or B7.1 were also constructed . Immunization with the IL-18/B7.1-transfected fibroblasts induced strong cytotoxic activities against OVA-expressing EL4 ( EG7 ) tumor cells , but not against other H-2( b ) tumor cells such as EL4 , C1498 , and B16F1 cells . The magnitude of the cytotoxic response in mice with the IL-18/B7.1-transfected fibroblasts was significantly higher than the response in mice immunized with any other cell constructs . CD8( + ) T cells with OVA-specific cytotoxic activities were predominant in mice immunized with the IL-18/B7.1-transfected fibroblasts .

"Broad immunogenicity of a multigene , multiclade HIV-1 DNA vaccine boosted with heterologous HIV-1 recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara .","BACKGROUND : A human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) vaccine that limits disease and transmission is urgently needed . This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV vaccine that combines a plasmid-DNA priming vaccine and a modified vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) boosting vaccine . METHODS : Forty healthy volunteers were injected with DNA plasmids containing gp160 of HIV-1 subtypes A , B , and C ; rev B ; p17/p24 gag A and B , and RTmut B by use of a needle-free injection system . The vaccine was administered intradermally or intramuscularly , with or without recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and boosted with a heterologous MVA containing env , gag , and pol of CRF01A_E. Immune responses were monitored with HIV-specific interferon ( IFN)-gamma and interleukin ( IL)-2 ELISpot and lymphoproliferative assays ( LPAs ) . RESULTS : Vaccine-related adverse events were mild and tolerable . After receipt of the DNA priming vaccine , 11 ( 30 % ) of 37 vaccinees had HIV-specific IFN-gamma responses . After receipt of the MVA boosting vaccine , ELISpot assays showed that 34 (92 % ) of 37 vaccinees had HIV-specific IFN-gamma responses , 32 (86 % ) to Gag and 24 ( 65 % ) to Env.

The animals were injected intratracheally with C. neoformans and monitored for clearance of the organism and the development of cellular immune response . CD40L(-/-) mice exhibited an exacerbation of infection , evaluated as scarce inflammatory response in the lung , that mirrored an increase of fungal burden .

"Intratumoral delivery of IL-18 naked DNA induces T-cell activation and Th1 response in a mouse hepatic cancer model .","BACKGROUND : The novel cytokine , interleukin ( IL)-18 , is a strong interferon-gamma inducer and costimulatory factor in Th1 cell activation . IL-18 triggers IFN-gamma production and enhances cytolytic activity in both T and NK cells . However , the exact mechanism of antitumor action of IL-18 remains to be clarified . To determine the effects of IL-18 plasmid DNA on hepatic cancer in mice , CT26 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells were established in mouse liver . METHODS : Plasmid vectors encoding IL-18 were transferred directly into the liver 7 days after tumor injection to restrict IL-18 expression within the tumor site . The IL-18 protein level was increased in the liver 4 days after plasmid injection , and a marked antitumoral effect was observed at day 7. Antitumor effects were evaluated by measuring tumor regression , immune cell population , and IFN-gamma production . RESULTS : The IL-18 plasmid controlled the growth of hepatic tumors and proliferation of splenic immune cells . Moreover , treatment of CT26 tumors with the IL-18 plasmid significantly enhanced the population of the effector T and NK cells in the spleen and peripheral blood . In spleen , the population of CD4+CD62Low cells was augmented in response to IL-18 on day 7. These results are consistent with the increase in CD4+ T cells secreting IFN-gamma , but not CD8+ T cells .

CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that direct plasmid DNA transfer of IL-18 with no accompanying reagents to augment transfection efficiency may be useful in tumor immunotherapy .","BMC cancer Intratumoral delivery of IL-18 naked DNA induces T-cell activation and Th1 response in a mouse hepatic cancer model . BACKGROUND : The novel cytokine , interleukin ( IL)-18 , is a strong interferon-gamma inducer and costimulatory factor in Th1 cell activation . IL-18 triggers IFN-gamma production and enhances cytolytic activity in both T and NK cells . However , the exact mechanism of antitumor action of IL-18 remains to be clarified . To determine the effects of IL-18 plasmid DNA on hepatic cancer in mice , CT26 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells were established in mouse liver . METHODS : Plasmid vectors encoding IL-18 were transferred directly into the liver 7 days after tumor injection to restrict IL-18 expression within the tumor site . The IL-18 protein level was increased in the liver 4 days after plasmid injection , and a marked antitumoral effect was observed at day 7. Antitumor effects were evaluated by measuring tumor regression , immune cell population , and IFN-gamma production . RESULTS : The IL-18 plasmid controlled the growth of hepatic tumors and proliferation of splenic immune cells . Moreover , treatment of CT26 tumors with the IL-18 plasmid significantly enhanced the population of the effector T and NK cells in the spleen and peripheral blood . In spleen , the population of CD4+CD62Low cells was augmented in response to IL-18 on day 7. These results are consistent with the increase in CD4+ T cells secreting IFN-gamma , but not CD8+ T cells . The marked reduction of tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice was associated with the maintenance of IFN-gamma production in spleen in response to IL-18 . These antitumoral effects were maintained until 14 days after plasmid injection . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that direct plasmid DNA transfer of IL-18 with no accompanying reagents to augment transfection efficiency may be useful in tumor immunotherapy .","Shun'ichiro Joh, Shun'ichiro Kwon, Shun'ichiro Park, Shun'ichiro Chang, Shun'ichiro Lee, Shun'ichiro Kim","Mouse-Cancer","PubMed"
"Regulation of ITAM-positive receptors : role of IL-12 and IL-18 .","Our previous studies have identified mechanisms by which cytokine production , blocked by Ly49G2 receptor cross-linking , can be overridden . In this study we analyzed the regulation of other ITAM-positive receptor signaling on NK , NKT , and T cells and characterized the biochemical pathways involved in this signaling . Our studies demonstrate that cross-linking of NKG2D and NK1.1 results in a synergistic NK IFN-gamma response when combined with IL-12 or IL-18 . Examination of NKT- and T-cell responses demonstrated that cross-linking of NKG2D and CD3 resulted in potent synergy when combined with IL-12 and , to a lesser degree , with IL-18 . We have now found that both the p38 MAP kinase and the ERK-dependent signal transduction pathways are required for the synergistic response . Further mechanistic examination of the synergy indicated a potent up-regulation of total IFN-gamma mRNA in the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartment , but mRNA half-life was not affected . Fifteen minutes of IL-12 pretreatment was sufficient to result in maximal synergistic activation , indicating that the response of the cells to the IL-12 signal was rapid and immediate . Thus , our data demonstrate that multiple convergent signals maximize the innate immune response by triggering complementary biochemical signaling pathways .","Blood Regulation of ITAM-positive receptors : role of IL-12 and IL-18 .

Recently , it has been reported that macrophages stimulated with these cytokines also produce IFNgamma , which led the authors to investigate the antiglioma activity of macrophages stimulated by the combination of these cytokines in vitro . METHODS : Dish-adherent peritoneal exudate cells , which had been elicited in thioglycollate broth as a source of macrophages , were used in the experiment . The murine glioma cell lines VM-glioma and 203G were labeled with [3H]thymidine for a cytotoxicity assay of macrophages . In response to the combined stimulation by IL-12 and IL-18 , macrophages expressed potent cytotoxic activity against glioma cells in association with increasing production of IFNgamma and nitric oxide ( NO ) . Inhibitors of NO abrogated the cytotoxic activity of the macrophages , which had been induced by IL-12 and IL-18 , despite the increase in IFNgamma production .

"Mouse Ly49 NK receptors : balancing activation and inhibition .","Previous studies from numerous laboratories have demonstrated that inhibitory class I binding NK receptors dominate functional interactions in vitro . Our previous studies have shown that in addition to lysis , a major consequence of triggering the murine activating NK receptor Ly49D is the expression of cytokines and chemokines . We have recently shown that the activating Ly49D murine NK cell receptor can potently synergize during co-stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 for selective production of IFN-gamma . Activation both in vitro and in vivo and synergistic production of IFN-gamma by Ly49D expressing NK cells results from cytokine stimulation combined with co-receptor ligation . In addition , IL-12 is capable of overriding the inhibitory receptor blockade for cytokine production , both in vitro and in vivo . Our current studies will expand this finding of IL-12 synergy to other receptors in the NK repertoire and evaluate potential biochemical mechanisms involved in this synergy . These findings place NK cells and their activating Ly49 receptors as important initiators of microbial , antiviral and anti-tumor immunity and provide a mechanism for the release of activating Ly49 receptors from an inhibitory receptor blockade . Discussion of how activation of the innate immune system provides important initiators of adaptive immune responses by receptor cross-linking and cytokine co-receptor engagement will ensue .","Molecular immunology Mouse Ly49 NK receptors : balancing activation and inhibition .

"Genetic and immunologic heterogeneity among persons who control HIV infection in the absence of therapy .","BACKGROUND : Spontaneous control of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection has been documented in a minority of HIV-infected individuals . The mechanisms behind this outcome remain largely unknown , and a better understanding of them will likely influence future vaccine strategies . METHODS : HIV-specific T cell and antibody responses as well as host genetics were examined in untreated HIV-infected patients who maintain comparatively low plasma HIV RNA levels ( hereafter , controllers ) , including those with levels of < 50 RNA copies/mL (elite controllers , n = 64 ) , those with levels of 50-2000 copies/mL (viremic controllers , n = 60 ) ; we also examined HIV-specific T cell and antibody responses as well as host genetics for patients with levels of >10,000 copies/mL ( chronic progressors , n = 30 ) . RESULTS : CD8+ T cells from both controller groups preferentially target Gag over other proteins in the context of diverse HLA class I alleles , whereas responses are more broadly distributed in persons with progressive infection . Elite controllers represent a distinct group of individuals who have significantly more CD4 and CD8 T cells that secrete interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 and lower levels of HIV-neutralizing antibodies . Individual responses were quite heterogeneous , and none of the parameters evaluated was uniquely associated with the ability to control viremia . CONCLUSIONS : Elite controllers are a distinct group , even when compared to persons with low level viremia , but they exhibit marked genetic and immunologic heterogeneity . Even low-level viremia among HIV controllers was associated with measurable T cell dysfunction , which has implications for current prophylactic vaccine strategies .","The Journal of infectious diseases Genetic and immunologic heterogeneity among persons who control HIV infection in the absence of therapy .

"Antitumor effects on mouse melanoma elicited by local secretion of interleukin-12 and their enhancement by treatment with interleukin-18 .","To investigate the mechanism of the antitumor effect of locally secreted interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , we introduced the IL-12 p35 and p40 cDNAs into mouse B16 melanoma cells . IL-12 gene-transfected B16 melanoma ( B16/IL12 ) showed marked retardation of tumor growth when implanted subcutaneously into syngeneic mice . In these mice , depletion of not only Natural Killer ( NK) cells but also CD8+ T cells diminished the antitumor effect of locally secreted IL-12 . Immunohistochemical analysis showed that NK cells and macrophages accumulated more densely at the center and periphery of B16/IL12 tumors than that of parental B16 tumors , whereas CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells accumulated sparsely only at the periphery of both transfected and untransfected tumors . Systemic treatment with interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) markedly inhibited the growth of B16/IL12 but did not influence the tumor growth of parental B16 cells in vivo .

"Posaconazole : an extended-spectrum triazole antifungal agent .","BACKGROUND : The incidence of invasive fungal infections ( IFIs ) caused by opportunistic filamentous molds is increasing , along with emerging fungal resistance . Posaconazole , a structural analogue of itraconazole that was approved for marketing in the United States in 2006 , appears to be a promising antifungal agent . OBJECTIVE : This article provides an overview of the pharmacology , efficacy , and tolerability of posaconazole when used for the prophylaxis and treatment of various common and rare fungal infections . METHODS : Relevant information was identified through a search of MEDLINE ( 1966-April 2007 ) , International Pharmaceutical Abstracts ( 1970-April 2007 ) , and abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy using the terms posaconazole and SCH 56592 . Additional resources were found by searching the reference lists of the identified articles and the US Food and Drug Administration Web site . RESULTS : Posaconazole is available as an oral suspension . It is highly distributed to various sites , including bone , the central nervous system , and eye tissue . Its Vd is 2447 L when administered in multiple daily doses (up to 800 mg/d ) in the presence of a high-fat meal . Because it is excreted mostly as unchanged drug in the feces ( 77 % ) , posaconazole can be administered to patients with poor renal function without any dose adjustment . Posaconazole has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of fungi , including those that are rare and relatively resistant . Two clinical trials have compared posaconazole with fluconazole or itraconazole for the prophylaxis of IFIs in immunocompromised patients . The first , a randomized , double-blind trial in 600 recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants , found that overall rates of IFI did not differ significantly between posaconazole and fluconazole ( 5 % vs 9 % , respectively ) . The other , a randomized , open-label trial in 602 neutropenic patients , reported significantly fewer IFIs in patients receiving posaconazole compared with those receiving fluconazole or itraconazole ( >2 % vs >8 % , respectively ; P = 0.001 ) . An additional 2 trials have investigated posaconazole for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) in patients with HIV infection . A randomized , controlled , evaluator-blinded study in 350 HIV-infected patients with OPC found similar 14-day clinical success rates with posaconazole and fluconazole (91.7 % and 92.5 % , respectively ; 95 % CI , -6.6l to 5.04 ) , whereas an open-label study in 176 HIV-infected patients with a history of refractory OPC reported a 28-day clinical success rate of 75 % . Numerous small studies and case reports have described successful posaconazole treatment of zygomycosis , aspergillosis , fusariosis , endemic dimorphic fungal infection , and superficial and subcutaneous fungal infections that were refractory to conventional antifungal agents or in patients who were unable to tolerate these agents . Posaconazole has been well tolerated . The most common complaints have been gastrointestinal in nature , including nausea ( 7%-8 % ) and diarrhea ( 3%-11 % ) , although these have rarely led to permanent discontinuation of therapy . Other common adverse effects have included vomiting ( 4%-7 % ) , headache ( 2%-8 % ) , and liver enzyme elevations ( 2%-3 % ) . CONCLUSIONS : Posaconazole suspension administered at up to 800 mg/d is a reasonable alternative to conventional antifungal agents for the prevention and treatment of IFIs in high-risk populations . It may also be suitable in patients with infections caused by rare or relatively resistant fungi , and those who are unable to tolerate long-term therapy with other antifungal agents .","Clinical therapeutics Posaconazole : an extended-spectrum triazole antifungal agent .

Concentrations of tumour necrosis factor receptor p55 ( TNFR p55 ) , macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF) , interleukin ( IL)-6 , IL-12 , interferon ( IFN)-gamma and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) were measured by ELISA , and correlated with mortality after 6 weeks follow-up .

"The Mamu B 17-restricted SIV Nef IW9 to TW9 mutation abrogates correct epitope processing and presentation without loss of replicative fitness .","CD8( + ) cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) play an important role in controlling virus replication in HIV- and SIV-infected humans and monkeys , respectively . Three well-studied SIV CTL determinants are the two Mamu A( )01-restricted epitopes Gag CM9 and Tat SL8 , and the Mamu B( )17-restricted epitope Nef IW9 . Point mutations leading to amino acid replacements in these epitopes have been reported to mediate SIV escape from CTL control . We found that synthetic peptides containing mutations in SIV Gag CM9 and Tat SL8 were no longer recognized by the respective CTL. On the other hand , the described I-to-T replacement at the N-terminal amino acid residue of the SIV Nef IW9 epitope only moderately affected CTL recognition of the variant peptide , TW9 .

CD8( + ) cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) play an important role in controlling virus replication in HIV- and SIV-infected humans and monkeys , respectively . Three well-studied SIV CTL determinants are the two Mamu A( )01-restricted epitopes Gag CM9 and Tat SL8 , and the Mamu B( )17-restricted epitope Nef IW9 . Point mutations leading to amino acid replacements in these epitopes have been reported to mediate SIV escape from CTL control . We found that synthetic peptides containing mutations in SIV Gag CM9 and Tat SL8 were no longer recognized by the respective CTL. On the other hand , the described I-to-T replacement at the N-terminal amino acid residue of the SIV Nef IW9 epitope only moderately affected CTL recognition of the variant peptide , TW9 .

"Overexpression of IL-18 decreases intimal collagen content and promotes a vulnerable plaque phenotype in apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice .","OBJECTIVE : Although IL-18 has been implicated in atherosclerotic lesion development , little is known about its role in advanced atherosclerotic plaques . This study aims to assess the effect of IL-18 overexpression on the stability of preexisting plaques . METHODS AND RESULTS : Atherosclerotic lesions were elicited in carotid arteries of apolipoprotein E ( apoE)-deficient mice ( n=32 ) by placement of a perivascular collar . Overexpression of IL-18 was effected by intravenous injection of an adenoviral vector 5 weeks after surgery . Two weeks after transduction , lesions were analyzed histologically with regard to plaque morphology and composition or by real-time polymerase chain reaction . No difference in plaque size was detected between groups . In the Ad.IL-18-treated group , 62 % of lesions displayed a vulnerable morphology or even intraplaque hemorrhage as compared with only 24 % in the controls ( P=0.037 ) . In agreement , IL-18 overexpression reduced intimal collagen by 44 % ( P<0.003 ) and cap-to-core ratio by 41 % ( P<0.002 ) . Although IL-18 did not affect the expression of collagen synthesis-related genes , it was found to enhance the collagenolytic activity of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro , suggesting that the low collagen content is attributable to matrix degradation rather than to decreased synthesis .

"Involvement of IL-17 in Fas ligand-induced inflammation .","Fas ligand ( FasL ) has been well characterized as a death factor . However , recent studies revealed that ectopic expression of FasL induces inflammation associated with massive neutrophil infiltration . We previously demonstrated that the neutrophil infiltration-inducing activity of FasL is partly dependent on , but partly independent of , IL-1beta . Here we investigated the cytokine profile of peritoneal lavage fluid obtained from mice that received i.p . injections of FFL , a FasL-expressing tumor cell line . We found that FFL injection caused a marked increase of not only IL-1beta but also IL-6 , IL-17 , IL-18 , KC/chemokine CXC ligand 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP)-2 , but not of IL-1alpha , IFN-gamma , TGF-beta or TNF-alpha . The FFL-induced cytokine production was not observed in Fas-deficient lpr mice . Among cells transfected to express individually IL-1beta , IL-6 , IL-17 , or IL-18 , only those expressing IL-1beta and IL-17 induced neutrophil infiltration . In these analyses , as little as 20 pg of peritoneal IL-17 induced neutrophil infiltration . The peritoneal IL-17 levels after FFL-injection were greatly diminished in IL-1-deficient mice .

"Ionizing radiation induces astrocyte gliosis through microglia activation .","The aim of this study was to investigate the role of microglia in radiation-induced astrocyte gliosis . We found that a single dose of 15 Gy radiation to a whole rat brain increased immunostaining of glial fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes 6 h later , and even more so 24 h later , indicating the initiation of gliosis . While irradiation of cultured rat astrocytes had little effect , irradiation of microglia-astrocyte mixed-cultures displayed altered astrocyte phenotype into more processed , which is another characteristic of gliosis . Experiments using microglia-conditioned media indicated this astrocyte change was due to factors released from irradiated microglia . Irradiation of cultured mouse microglial cells induced a dose-dependent increase in mRNA levels for cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , interleukin ( IL)-1beta , IL-6 , IL-18 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 , which are usually associated with microglia activation .

"Impaired hepatitis C virus-specific T cell responses and recurrent hepatitis C virus in HIV coinfection .","BACKGROUND : Hepatitis C virus ( HCV)-specific T cell responses are critical for spontaneous resolution of HCV viremia . Here we examined the effect of a lymphotropic virus , HIV-1 , on the ability of coinfected patients to maintain spontaneous control of HCV infection . METHODS AND FINDINGS : We measured T cell responsiveness by lymphoproliferation and interferon-gamma ELISPOT in a large cohort of HCV-infected individuals with and without HIV infection . Among 47 HCV/HIV-1-coinfected individuals , spontaneous control of HCV was associated with more frequent HCV-specific lymphoproliferative ( LP ) responses ( 35 % ) compared to coinfected persons who exhibited chronic HCV viremia ( 7 % , p = 0.016 ) , but less frequent compared to HCV controllers who were not HIV infected (86 % , p = 0.003 ) . Preservation of HCV-specific LP responses in coinfected individuals was associated with a higher nadir CD4 count ( r( 2 ) = 0.45 , p < 0.001 ) and the presence and magnitude of the HCV-specific CD8( + ) T cell interferon-gamma response ( p = 0.0014 ) . During long-term follow-up , recurrence of HCV viremia occurred in six of 25 coinfected individuals with prior control of HCV , but in 0 of 16 HIV-1-negative HCV controllers ( p = 0.03 , log rank test ) . In these six individuals with recurrent HCV viremia , the magnitude of HCV viremia following recurrence inversely correlated with the CD4 count at time of breakthrough ( r = -0.94 , p = 0.017 ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that HIV infection impairs the immune response to HCV-including in persons who have cleared HCV infection-and that HIV-1-infected individuals with spontaneous control of HCV remain at significant risk for a second episode of HCV viremia . These findings highlight the need for repeat viral RNA testing of apparent controllers of HCV infection in the setting of HIV-1 coinfection and provide a possible explanation for the higher rate of HCV persistence observed in this population .","PLoS medicine Impaired hepatitis C virus-specific T cell responses and recurrent hepatitis C virus in HIV coinfection .

CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that HIV infection impairs the immune response to HCV-including in persons who have cleared HCV infection-and that HIV-1-infected individuals with spontaneous control of HCV remain at significant risk for a second episode of HCV viremia . These findings highlight the need for repeat viral RNA testing of apparent controllers of HCV infection in the setting of HIV-1 coinfection and provide a possible explanation for the higher rate of HCV persistence observed in this population .","Tsuneya Timm, Tsuneya Gandhi, Tsuneya Kaufmann, Tsuneya Wurcel, Tsuneya Walker, Tsuneya Kim, Tsuneya Robbins, Tsuneya Duncan, Tsuneya Schulze zur Wiesch, Tsuneya Lauer, Tsuneya Kuntzen, Tsuneya Allen, Tsuneya Chung, Tsuneya Davis, Tsuneya Jones","Human-Aids","PubMed"

METHODS : To study CTL responses , mAFP-expressing recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated . An HCC tumor model was established in C57L/J mice by injection of syngeneic endogenously mAFP-expressing Hepa1-6 cells . RESULTS : Gene gun and intramuscular coimmunizations of DNA expression vectors encoding mAFP with plasmids encoding murine interleukin ( IL)-12 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , or IL-18 induced weak CTL activity against mAFP in different mouse strains . Some mice developed anti-mAFP antibody responses , suggesting breaking of immunologic ignorance . No hepatocyte damage was detectable despite low-level endogenous hepatic mAFP expression .

"Live attenuated Salmonella as a vector for oral cytokine gene therapy in melanoma .","Systemic administration of cytokines has shown therapeutic benefits in cancer patients ; however , serious adverse effects associated with direct protein administration prevent the wide use of this approach . We have assessed the capacity of live attenuated Salmonella to act as a vector for oral cytokine-gene therapy . Salmonella orally administered to melanoma-bearing mice was found to accumulate within the tumor , reaching up to 10(5 ) bacteria per gram of tumor by day 21 after bacterial inoculation . Numbers of bacteria recovered from tumor did not differ from those recovered from liver or spleen at any time point . Recombinant bacteria carrying eukaryotic expression vectors encoding the murine IL-4 or IL-18 genes were administered to groups of mice with established subcutaneous melanoma tumors . We found that a single oral dose of Salmonella carrying any of the cytokine-encoding plasmids resulted in significantly increased survival time , as compared with mice that received Salmonella carrying the parental plasmid or PBS. Increased levels of IFNgamma were found in sera of animals receiving either of the cytokine-encoding bacteria , but not in mice receiving Salmonella alone or PBS. Co-administration of both recombinant bacteria maximized the production of IFNgamma . Overall these results suggest that cytokine-encoding Salmonella can be an effective and safer alternative to systemic administration of cytokines for immunotherapy of cancer .","The journal of gene medicine Live attenuated Salmonella as a vector for oral cytokine gene therapy in melanoma .

"Sequence variation occurs in CD4 epitopes during early HIV infection .","OBJECTIVE : To determine whether viral sequence variation occurs in HIV-specific CD4 epitopes during early HIV infection . METHODS : Gag , Nef , and integrase ( Int ) sequences were obtained from the plasma of 7 subjects identified during acute HIV-1 infection . Changes in the viral sequence were determined based on comparison of sequences obtained at 2 time points during early infection . Peptide-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were measured at matched time points using interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays to identify CD4 epitopes . RESULTS : An average of 4 mutations were identified per subject . The majority of the mutations were nonsynonymous and resulted in a total of 6 amino acid changes in Gag , 7 changes in Nef , and 6 changes and a deletion in Int . Half of the sequence changes were within recognized CD4 epitopes . Mutations within CD4 epitopes were coincident with changes in the peptide-specific CD4 response .

CD4 T cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin , and MDM were induced from monocytes using macrophage-colony stimulating factor . HIV-1 replication was monitored by p24 antigen capture assay . The gene expression profiles were analysed using DNA microarray analysis . The increase in the expression of IFN-inducible genes ( IFIG ) was confirmed by the Quantigene plex assay . RESULTS : Both cytokines preferentially inhibited HIV-1 replication in MDM compared with CD4 T cells . Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay using anti-IFN indicated that IFN-alpha , IFN-beta and IFN-gamma had no significant impact on IL-27-mediated HIV inhibition .

"Antimetastatic effect of CpG DNA mediated by type I IFN.","The mechanisms involved in the antimetastatic effect of CpG-containing DNA were investigated in a mouse model of experimental metastasis .

The i .v. injection of plasmid DNA or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODNs ) containing unmethylated CpG motifs before tumor cell application strongly inhibited metastasis . Because synthetic CpG-ODN was not directly tumor cytotoxic , the target cells for this CpG-ODN effect were determined . The cytotoxic activity on standard natural killer ( NK) targets as well as on fibrosarcoma cells of splenic NK cells and NKT cell-containing liver mononuclear cells derived from CpG-ODN-treated mice was strongly enhanced .

"NKG2D recognition and perforin effector function mediate effective cytokine immunotherapy of cancer .","Single and combination cytokines offer promise in some patients with advanced cancer . Many spontaneous and experimental cancers naturally express ligands for the lectin-like type-2 transmembrane stimulatory NKG2D immunoreceptor ; however , the role this tumor recognition pathway plays in immunotherapy has not been explored to date . Here , we show that natural expression of NKG2D ligands on tumors provides an effective target for some cytokine-stimulated NK cells to recognize and suppress tumor metastases . In particular , interleukin ( IL)-2 or IL-12 suppressed tumor metastases largely via NKG2D ligand recognition and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity . By contrast , IL-18 required tumor sensitivity to Fas ligand ( FasL ) and surprisingly did not depend on the NKG2D-NKG2D ligand pathway . A combination of IL-2 and IL-18 stimulated both perforin and FasL effector mechanisms with very potent effects . Cytokines that stimulated perforin-mediated cytotoxicity appeared relatively more effective against tumor metastases expressing NKG2D ligands .

"Lower levels of gamma interferon expressed by a pseudotyped single-cycle simian immunodeficiency virus enhance immunogenicity in rats .","A vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection is desperately needed to control the AIDS pandemic . To address this problem , we constructed single-cycle simian immunodeficiency viruses ( SIVs ) pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus and expressing different levels of gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) as a potential vaccine strategy . We previously showed that IFN-gamma expression by pseudotyped SIVs does not alter viral single-cycle infectivity . T cells primed with dendritic cells transduced by pseudotyped SIVs expressing high levels of IFN-gamma had stronger T-cell responses than those primed with dendritic cells transduced by constructs lacking IFN-gamma . In the present study , we tested the immunogenicities of these pseudotyped SIVs in a rat model . The construct expressing low levels of rat IFN-gamma ( dSIV(LRgamma ) ) induced higher levels of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses than the construct lacking IFN-gamma ( dSIV( R) ) . Rats vaccinated with dSIV(LRgamma ) also had lower viral loads than those vaccinated with dSIV( R ) when inoculated with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SIV Gag-Pol as a surrogate challenge . The construct expressing high levels of IFN-gamma ( dSIV(HRgamma ) ) did not further enhance immunity and was less protective than dSIV(LRgamma ) . In conclusion , the data indicated that IFN-gamma functioned as an adjuvant to augment antigen-specific immune responses in a dose - and cell type-related manner in vivo . Thus , fine-tuning of the cytokine expression appears to be essential in designing vaccine vectors expressing adjuvant genes such as the gene for IFN-gamma .

"Anticarcinogenesis pathways activated by bovine lactoferrin in the murine small intestine .","Oral administration of bovine lactoferrin ( bLF ) inhibits carcinogenesis in the colon and other organs in rats , and lung metastasis in mice . A likely mechanism by which bLF mediates its anticarcinogenesis effects is by enhanced expression of cytokines and subsequent activation of immune cells . Oral administration of bLF enhances expression of interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) mRNA in the mucosa of the small intestine of mice . Importantly , the pepsin hydrolysate of bLF ( bLFH) also induced expression of IL-18 mRNA in the mouse small intestine and a peptide produced by pepsin digestion of bLF , bovine lactoferricin ( bLFcin ) , induced expression of mature IL-18 in organ culture . In addition to IL-18 , bLF and bLFcin both induced significant increases in caspase-1 activity in peritoneal macrophages and in organ cultures . The increase of mature IL-18 by macrophages was inhibited by caspase-1 inhibitor : caspase-1 is known to cleave the proform of IL-18 to produce active mature IL-18 . Finally , bLF also induced expression of IFNgamma by peritoneal macrophages . Importantly , in IFNgamma knockout ( GKO ) mice , bLF administration resulted in increased expression of caspase-1 protein , but induction of IL-18 mRNA , caspase-1 activity , and mature IL-18 was not observed . These results indicate that orally administered bLF can induce expression of IFNgamma and caspase-1 in the small intestine . IFNgamma in turn increases expression of target genes , including IL-18 . Active caspase-1 then cleaves pro-IL-18 to generate mature IL-18 . Thus , bLF activates an effector pathway mediated by IFNgamma , caspase-1 , and IL-18 .

"Calcium-pterin suppresses mitogen-induced tryptophan degradation and neopterin production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells .","Antitumor activity of a calcium-pterin suspension has been described in vitro and in animal model systems . Recent studies provide some evidence that this effect involves immune-mediated mechanisms . We investigated the influence of calcium-pterin on freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) stimulated with the mitogens phytohaemagglutinin and concanavalin A in vitro .

"HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses against immunodominant optimal epitopes slow the progression of AIDS in China .","To assess the immunodominance patterns of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses and the contribution of these responses against the peptides scanning optimal epitopes in chronic infection , we test the HIV-1-specific CTL responses against a panel of 413 overlapping peptides spanning HIV-1 Asian B sequence , including 147 peptides corresponding to optimal clade B epitopes in 49 chronically HIV-1 infected individuals by interferon-gamma Elispot assay . A large variation in the recognition of peptides restricted by the same HLA class I allele is presented . Some epitopes are targeted frequently by individuals while other epitopes restricted by the same allele are rarely recognized in our research . HLA-B35 and HLA-A03 rather than other HLA alleles contribute greatly to total virus-specific CTL responses . Furthermore , there is a significant inverse correlation between the total contribution of HIV-1-specific CTL responses restricted by different HLA alleles to virus-specific immune responses and viral load in the individuals during advanced infection ( P=0.002 , r=-0.549 ) .

To assess the immunodominance patterns of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses and the contribution of these responses against the peptides scanning optimal epitopes in chronic infection , we test the HIV-1-specific CTL responses against a panel of 413 overlapping peptides spanning HIV-1 Asian B sequence , including 147 peptides corresponding to optimal clade B epitopes in 49 chronically HIV-1 infected individuals by interferon-gamma Elispot assay . A large variation in the recognition of peptides restricted by the same HLA class I allele is presented . Some epitopes are targeted frequently by individuals while other epitopes restricted by the same allele are rarely recognized in our research . HLA-B35 and HLA-A03 rather than other HLA alleles contribute greatly to total virus-specific CTL responses . Furthermore , there is a significant inverse correlation between the total contribution of HIV-1-specific CTL responses restricted by different HLA alleles to virus-specific immune responses and viral load in the individuals during advanced infection ( P=0.002 , r=-0.549 ) .

"The radiosensitizing effect of immunoadjuvant OM-174 requires cooperation between immune and tumor cells through interferon-gamma and inducible nitric oxide synthase .","PURPOSE : To explore whether antitumor immunoadjuvant OM-174 can stimulate immune cells to produce interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and thereby radiosensitize tumor cells . METHODS AND MATERIALS : Splenocytes from BALB/c mice were stimulated by OM-174 at plasma-achievable concentrations ( 0.03-3 mug/mL ) , and afterward analyzed for the expression and secretion of IFN-gamma by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , respectively . Stimulated splenocytes were used as a source of IFN-gamma to radiosensitize hypoxic EMT-6 tumor cells through the cytokine-inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) . RESULTS : OM-174 activated the production of IFN-gamma at high levels that reached 70 ng/mL in normoxia ( 21 % oxygen ) and 27 ng/mL in tumor-relevant hypoxia ( 1 % oxygen ) . This caused up to 2.1-fold radiosensitization of EMT-6 tumor cells , which was associated with the iNOS-mediated production of the radiosensitizing molecule nitric oxide , as confirmed by accumulation of its oxidative metabolite nitrite , Western blot analysis , and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .

The actual promiscuity of HLA binding of the 18 selected peptides was assessed by binding assays to nine prevalent HLA-DR molecules .

"Secreted type of modified interleukin-18 gene transduced into mouse renal cell carcinoma cells induces systemic tumor immunity .","PURPOSE : Interleukin ( IL)-18 is a novel cytokine that has been identified as a strong interferon-gamma inducer . IL-18 has bioactivity similar to that of IL-12 and demonstrates antitumor effects . Since IL-18 does not have a signal sequence , we constructed the gene , consisting of the signal sequences of interferon-beta and mature IL-18 complementary ( c ) DNA . The modified gene was subsequently transduced into a mouse renal cell carcinoma cell line to induce IL-18 secretion from tumor cells to establish whether this IL-18 secreting tumor cell line may induce systemic tumor immunity . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Modified IL-18 cDNA consisting of the signal sequences of interferon-beta and mature type of IL-18 cDNA was constructed by the overlap extension method . The modified and original IL-18 cDNA was transduced into the RenCa mouse renal cell carcinoma cell line . Expression of IL-18 messenger RNA and concentration of IL-18 in the culture supernatant were determined . Direct antitumor and tumor vaccine effects were investigated in syngeneic Balb/c mice . To determine the mechanism of the antitumor effect immunodeficient mice were challenged with IL-18 secreting RenCa cells . RESULTS : Although the modified and original IL-18 genes transduced RenCa showed almost the same level of IL-18 messenger RNA expression , only RenCa cells transduced with modified IL-18 gene secreted IL-18 into the culture supernatant and were completely rejected when transplanted into syngeneic mice . T lymphocytes were involved in this antitumor effect . Moreover , the modified IL-18 transduced RenCa induced tumor vaccine effect against parental RenCa cells injected at a distant site .

"Engineered fusion hybrid vaccine of IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells and dendritic cells induces enhanced antitumor immunity .","Dendritic cell (DC)-tumor fusion hybrid vaccines that facilitate antigen presentation represent a novel powerful strategy in cancer immunotherapy . In our study , we investigated the antitumor immunity derived from the vaccination of fusion hybrids between engineered J558/IL-18 myeloma cells secreting Th1 cytokine IL-18 and DCs . DC/J558/IL-18 could secret a higher level of IL-18 than DCs , efficiently expressed J558 tumor antigen P1A , and enhanced ability of allogeneic T cell stimulation when compared to J558/IL-18 .

Sixty intravenous drug users infected with HIV-1 circulating recombinant form 07_BC ( CRF07_BC ) , which has been spreading rapidly in western China from north to south , were recruited from Xinjiang , China to assess the HIV-1-specific T cell responses at single peptide level with overlapping peptides ( OLP ) covering the whole concensus clades B and C proteome . RESULTS : The median of the total magnitude and total number of OLPs recognized by CTL responses were 10925 SFC/million PBMC and 25 OLPs , respectively , when tested by clade C peptides , which was significantly higher than when tested by clade B peptides . The immunodominant regions , which cover 14 % ( 58/413 ) of the HIV-1 proteome , are widely distributed throughout the HIV-1 proteome except in Tat , Vpu and Pol-PR , with Gag , Pol-RT , Pol-Int and Nef being most frequently targeted . The subdominant epitopes are mostly located in p24 , Nef , integrase , Vpr and Vif . Of the responses directed to clade C OLPs , 61.75 % (972/1574 ) can be observed when tested with corresponding clade B OLPs . However , Pol-PR and Vpu tend to be targeted in the clade B sequence rather than the clade C sequence , which is in line with the recombinant pattern of CRF07_BC .

We combined an analysis of 21 escape events in longitudinally-studied HIV-1 infected people with a population-level analysis of the functional CTL response in 150 subjects ( by IFNg ELISpot ) and an analysis of the HIV-1 sequence database to quantify the contribution of escape to the HLA-associated rate of AIDS progression . We found that CTL responses restricted by protective HLA class I alleles , which are associated with slow progression to AIDS , recognised epitopes where escape variants had a weak evolutionary selective advantage ( P = 0.008 ) and occurred infrequently ( P = 0.017 ) . Epitopes presented by protective HLA class I alleles were more likely to elicit a CTL response ( P = 0.001 ) and less likely to contain sequence variation ( P = 0.006 ) . A third of between-individual variation in HLA-associated disease risk was predicted by the selective advantage of escape variants : a doubling in the evolutionary selective advantage was associated with a decrease in the AIDS-free period of 1.2 yrs .

"New approaches to the treatment of AIDS with special reference to overcoming interferon resistance .","This is a brief review on studies of attacking HIV through a new angle . In previous studies , we have found that many patients with AIDS are resistant to interferon ( IFN ) therapy , and some develop resistance during therapy . Four factors were found to be responsible for the resistance of untreated patients : ( a ) . release of free-circulating IFN-alpha/beta type 1 receptors , ( b ) . a newly detected IFN inhibitory protein , ( c ) . high prostaglandin E2 , and ( d ) . high levels of cAMP phosphodiesterases , particularly in AIDS-related neoplasms . This may interfere with intrinsic disease resistance and with the efficacy of IFN therapy . In an attempt to overcome this resistance , new compounds were synthesized which increase endogenous production of alpha , beta and gamma IFNs , have anti-template activity against DNA and RNA polymerases , inhibit reverse transcriptases and activates IFN-induced double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase . It is expected that planned nonhuman primate and clinical studies will support preliminary findings . Preliminary in vitro and animal studies suggest that these new compounds may be effective against HIV , including multi-drug resistant strains .","Journal of medicine New approaches to the treatment of AIDS with special reference to overcoming interferon resistance .

Four factors were found to be responsible for the resistance of untreated patients : ( a ) . release of free-circulating IFN-alpha/beta type 1 receptors , ( b ) . a newly detected IFN inhibitory protein , ( c ) . high prostaglandin E2 , and ( d ) . high levels of cAMP phosphodiesterases , particularly in AIDS-related neoplasms . This may interfere with intrinsic disease resistance and with the efficacy of IFN therapy . In an attempt to overcome this resistance , new compounds were synthesized which increase endogenous production of alpha , beta and gamma IFNs , have anti-template activity against DNA and RNA polymerases , inhibit reverse transcriptases and activates IFN-induced double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase . It is expected that planned nonhuman primate and clinical studies will support preliminary findings . Preliminary in vitro and animal studies suggest that these new compounds may be effective against HIV , including multi-drug resistant strains .","Tsuneya Dembinski, Tsuneya Bardos, Tsuneya Chadha, Tsuneya Ambrus","Human-Aids","PubMed"
"[ Usefulness of a whole blood interferon gamma assay ( QuantiFERON-TB-2G ) for detecting tuberculosis infection in HIV-infected persons ]","BACKGROUND : New blood test ( QuantiFERON-TB-2G : QFT-2G) , based on detection of IFN-gamma released by T cells in response to M. tuberculosis specific antigens , has the high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of tuberculosis . However , it is essential to evaluate this T cell-based approach in individuals with HIV-associated impairment in T cell immunity . METHODS : We assessed the usefulness of QFT-2G on diagnosis of tuberculosis in 13 HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis and the performance of 25 HIV infected persons under highly active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) . QFT-2G , CD4 counts , and tuberculosis skin test and so on were examined . RESULTS : The sensitivity of QFT-2G in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis was 76.9 % , which was significantly higher compared with tuberculin skin test , 15.4 % .

"Intratumoral injection of IL-secreting syngeneic/allogeneic fibroblasts transfected with DNA from breast cancer cells prolongs the survival of mice with intracerebral breast cancer .","Prior studies have revealed the immunotherapeutic properties of a vaccine prepared by transfer of genomic DNA from breast cancer cells into a highly immunogenic cell line . The rationale for this type of vaccine is that genes specifying an array of weakly immunogenic , unique tumor antigens associated with the malignant cells will be expressed in a highly immunogenic form by the transfected cells . Here , the immunotherapeutic properties of a vaccine prepared by transfection of mouse fibroblasts with DNA from a breast carcinoma ( SB-5b ) that arose spontaneously in a C3H/He mouse (H-2Kb ) were tested in mice with intracerebral breast cancer . To augment their nonspecific immunogenic properties , before DNA transfer , the fibroblasts ( of C3H/He mouse origin ) were modified to express allogeneic MHC class I H-2Kb-determinants and to secrete IL-2 , IL-18 or GM-CSF. The results indicate that C3H/He mice injected intracerebrally ( i.c. ) with the breast cancer cells and syngeneic/allogeneic-transfected fibroblasts modified to secrete IL-2 survived significantly longer ( P < .005 ) than mice in various control groups , including mice injected i.c. with the breast cancer cells alone . The immunotherapeutic properties of transfected fibroblasts modified to secrete IL-18 or GM-CSF were less efficacious .

The rationale for this type of vaccine is that genes specifying an array of weakly immunogenic , unique tumor antigens associated with the malignant cells will be expressed in a highly immunogenic form by the transfected cells . Here , the immunotherapeutic properties of a vaccine prepared by transfection of mouse fibroblasts with DNA from a breast carcinoma ( SB-5b ) that arose spontaneously in a C3H/He mouse (H-2Kb ) were tested in mice with intracerebral breast cancer . To augment their nonspecific immunogenic properties , before DNA transfer , the fibroblasts ( of C3H/He mouse origin ) were modified to express allogeneic MHC class I H-2Kb-determinants and to secrete IL-2 , IL-18 or GM-CSF. The results indicate that C3H/He mice injected intracerebrally ( i.c. ) with the breast cancer cells and syngeneic/allogeneic-transfected fibroblasts modified to secrete IL-2 survived significantly longer ( P < .005 ) than mice in various control groups , including mice injected i.c. with the breast cancer cells alone . The immunotherapeutic properties of transfected fibroblasts modified to secrete IL-18 or GM-CSF were less efficacious .

"Molecular mechanism( s ) involved in the synergistic induction of CXCL10 by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat and interferon-gamma in macrophages .","Synergistic interactions between viral proteins and soluble host factors released from infected mononuclear phagocytes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)-associated dementia ( HAD ) . The chemokine CXCL10 has been found to be closely associated with the progression of HIV-1-related central nervous system ( CNS ) disease and its related neuropsychiatric impairment . In this report the authors demonstrate that the HIV-1 protein Tat can interact with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon ( IFN)-gamma to dramatically induce the expression of CXCL10 in macrophages . Synergistic induction of CXCL10 by both Tat and IFN-gamma was susceptible to inhibition by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 . In addition , JAK/STAT pathway plays a major role in Tat/gamma-mediated CXCL10 induction in macrophages because pretreatment of stimulated macrophages with JAK inhibitor completely abrogated the synergistic induction of the chemokine . Functionality of the synergistically induced CXCL10 was further demonstrated by its chemotactic activity for peripheral blood lymphocytes . Taken together , these findings demonstrate that the cooperative interaction of Tat and IFN-gamma results in enhanced chemokine expression , which in turn can amplify the inflammatory responses within the CNS of HAD patients by recruiting more lymphocytes in the brain .","Journal of neurovirology Molecular mechanism( s ) involved in the synergistic induction of CXCL10 by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat and interferon-gamma in macrophages .

"Clinical , immunological , and epidemiological importance of antituberculosis T cell responses in HIV-infected Africans .","BACKGROUND : Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)-associated tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality in Africa . The assay of T cell interferon - gamma released in response to antigens of greater specificity than purified protein derivative is a useful improvement over the Mantoux tuberculin skin test , but few studies have evaluated interferon-gamma secretion in HIV-infected individuals . METHODS : Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-specific interferon-gamma secretion was assessed by whole blood assay and enzyme-linked immunospot , which were compared with the Mantoux tuberculin skin test in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals without active tuberculosis and HIV-infected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Khayelitsha , South Africa . RESULTS : The skin test and whole blood assay responses to purified protein derivative in HIV-positive subjects were decreased , compared with responses in HIV-negative subjects ( P < .001 ) . By contrast , the responses to M. tuberculosis antigens ( early secreted antigenic target 6 , culture filtrate protein 10 , TB10.3 , and alpha-crystallin 2 ) were less affected , indicating a high prevalence of latent tuberculosis ( approximately 80 % ) in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive subject groups . Whole blood assay responses did not differ between the HIV-positive subjects without tuberculosis and HIV-positive subjects with tuberculosis , but the enzyme-linked immunospot method response to early secreted antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10 was higher in the group of HIV-infected subjects with tuberculosis ( P < or = .04 ) , although this group had lower CD4+ cell counts . A ratio of the combined enzyme-linked immunospot method response divided by the CD4+ cell count of > 1.0 had 88 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals . CONCLUSIONS : Interferon-gamma release appears to be less impaired than skin testing by HIV coinfection .

BACKGROUND : Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)-associated tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality in Africa . The assay of T cell interferon - gamma released in response to antigens of greater specificity than purified protein derivative is a useful improvement over the Mantoux tuberculin skin test , but few studies have evaluated interferon-gamma secretion in HIV-infected individuals . METHODS : Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-specific interferon-gamma secretion was assessed by whole blood assay and enzyme-linked immunospot , which were compared with the Mantoux tuberculin skin test in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals without active tuberculosis and HIV-infected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Khayelitsha , South Africa . RESULTS : The skin test and whole blood assay responses to purified protein derivative in HIV-positive subjects were decreased , compared with responses in HIV-negative subjects ( P < .001 ) . By contrast , the responses to M. tuberculosis antigens ( early secreted antigenic target 6 , culture filtrate protein 10 , TB10.3 , and alpha-crystallin 2 ) were less affected , indicating a high prevalence of latent tuberculosis ( approximately 80 % ) in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive subject groups . Whole blood assay responses did not differ between the HIV-positive subjects without tuberculosis and HIV-positive subjects with tuberculosis , but the enzyme-linked immunospot method response to early secreted antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10 was higher in the group of HIV-infected subjects with tuberculosis ( P < or = .04 ) , although this group had lower CD4+ cell counts . A ratio of the combined enzyme-linked immunospot method response divided by the CD4+ cell count of > 1.0 had 88 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals . CONCLUSIONS : Interferon-gamma release appears to be less impaired than skin testing by HIV coinfection .

"Interleukin-10-secreting CD4 cells from aged patients with AIDS decrease in-vitro HIV replication and tumour necrosis factor alpha production .","OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the impact of age on the proliferative response , cytokine profile and viral kinetics in AIDS patients treated successfully with antiretroviral drugs . METHODS : Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) , CD4 cell-depleted PBMC or CD4 T cells from young adult and aged HIV-1-infected patients were activated in vitro with anti-CD3 with or without interleukin ( IL)-2 . Lymphoproliferation and cytokines were measured after 3 days and in-vitro HIV-1 replication after 7 days . RESULTS : Both lymphoproliferation and cytokine [IL-1beta , tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) ] secretion were higher in younger than in older AIDS patients . In cultures of cells derived from aged patients and activated by anti-CD3 , IFN-gamma production was severely damage and IL-10 production was much higher . Although IL-2 addition to activated PBMC elevated IFN-gamma secretion , IL-10 production remained elevated in the aged group . The depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes from these cultures dramatically reduced released IL-10 in the older group but did not alter significantly IFN-gamma production . Interestingly , higher IL-10 levels produced by CD4 T cells were related to lower in-vitro HIV-1 replication , and the blockade of this cytokine by anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody enhanced virus replication . This effect may be correlated with elevated TNF-alpha secretion . Finally , impaired IFN-gamma secretion detected in activated CD4 T cells obtained from aged patients was not directly correlated with high IL-10 production .

"Histamine improves survival and protects against interleukin-2-induced pulmonary vascular leak syndrome in mice .","The therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of metastatic cancer with high doses of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) has been limited by the onset of vascular leak syndrome (VLS ) and related toxicities . VLS is characterized by an increase in vascular permeability and severe hypotension resulting in interstitial edema and organ failure . This study explores the protective effects of histamine dihydrochloride ( HDC ) against IL-2-induced toxicities in mice . Treatment with HDC administered before or after IL-2 ( 1.25 x 10(6 ) IU , BID ) was shown to protect mice from VLS-related toxicities and mortality in a dose-dependent manner . Survival rates when HDC was added were 56 , 75 and 81 % at doses of 0.47 , 4.7 and 47.0 mg/kg , respectively , compared to 42 % survival with IL-2 alone . HDC protected against IL-2-induced macroscopic pulmonary lesions , reduced edema (up to 62 % reduction in lung wet/dry weight ratio ) and reduced capillary leakage into the lungs as measured by a reduction in Evans Blue dye content . In addition , the systemic effect on serum cytokine levels showed that HDC only moderately lowered IL-2 induced IFN-gamma , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-18 and TNF-alpha . Serum levels of IL-1beta , IL-4 and IL-12 were not measurably induced by IL-2 treatment .

"Extracellular acidosis triggers the maturation of human dendritic cells and the production of IL-12 .","Although the development of an acidic tissue environment or acidosis is a hallmark of inflammatory processes , few studies analyze the effect of extracellular pH on immune cells . We have previously shown that exposure of murine dendritic cells (DCs ) to pH 6.5 stimulates macropinocytosis and cross-presentation of extracellular Ags by MHC class I molecules . We report that the transient exposure of human DCs to pH 6.5 markedly increases the expression of HLA-DR , CD40 , CD80 , CD86 , CD83 , and CCR7 and improves the T cell priming ability of DCs . Incubation of DCs at pH 6.5 results in the activation of the PI3K/Akt and the MAPK pathways .

DC exposure to pH 6.5 also induces a dramatic increase in their production of IL-12 , stimulating the synthesis of IFN-gamma , but not IL-4 , by Ag-specific CD4( + ) T cells .

We have observed a nascent , but ineffective , host immune response against 3LL that depends on endogenous IFN-gamma and IL-12 production and the Fas/Fas ligand ( Fas-L) pathway . The combined administration of IL-18/IL-2 engages this endogenous response to induce tumor regression via a mechanism that is independent of NK and NKT cells or IL-12 , but is critically dependent on CD8( + ) T cells , IFN-gamma , and the Fas/Fas-L pathway . These studies demonstrate the importance of IFN-gamma as well as the Fas/Fas-L pathway in both endogenous and cytokine-driven antitumor immune responses engaged by IL-18/IL-2 and provide preclinical impetus for clinical investigation of this potent anti-tumor combination .","Shun'ichiro Back, Shun'ichiro Alvord, Shun'ichiro Wiltrout, Shun'ichiro Hixon, Shun'ichiro Subleski, Shun'ichiro Lee, Shun'ichiro Wigginton","Mouse-Cancer","PubMed"
"Ionizing radiation stimulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines : dose-response relationship , mechanisms and implications .","In previous studies we showed a marked increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha and interleukin ( IL)-1beta by mouse macrophages in response to different doses of ionizing radiation ( IR ) . Here we show the stimulation of IL-12 and IL-18 secretion by mouse peritoneal macrophages after whole-body irradiation with exploration of the possible mechanisms and implications in cancer radiotherapy . Both low ( 0.075 Gy ) and high ( 2 Gy ) doses of IR were found to cause sustained stimulation of IL-12 and IL-18 secretion by mouse macrophages ; this paralleled the activation of NF-kappaB as well as up-regulated expression of CD14 and TLR4-MD2 on the macrophage surface and MyD88 in the cytoplasm . The expression of CD14 , TLR4-MD2 and MyD88 increased in a dose-dependent manner from radiation doses between 0.05 and 2 Gy . The secretion of IL-12 and IL-18 showed a dose-dependent increase from doses between 0.05 and 4 Gy . It is concluded that IR can stimulate the secretion of IL-12 and IL-18 presumably via activation of the Toll signaling pathway in macrophages . The potential harmful effect of repeated doses of radiation used in radiotherapy for certain cancers is discussed .","Radiation and environmental biophysics Ionizing radiation stimulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines : dose-response relationship , mechanisms and implications .

"Aspergillus to Zygomycetes : causes , risk factors , prevention , and treatment of invasive fungal infections .","Invasive fungal infections ( IFIs ) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality , particularly in patients with underlying risk factors ( e .g. , neutropenia , cancer chemotherapy , transplantation , AIDS ) . Although Candida species remain a relevant cause of IFI , other organisms ( particularly moulds ) have become increasingly prevalent . In particular , Aspergillus species are the leading cause of mould infections although other moulds including Fusarium species and Zygomycetes are increasing in frequency , and are associated with a high mortality rate . Options available for the prevention and treatment of these infections include standard and liposomal formulations of amphotericin B , but toxicity concerns limit their use ; fluconazole is effective for the prevention and treatment of candidiasis but its inactivity against moulds and increasing resistance are limiting factors . Newer azoles , particularly voriconazole and posaconazole , have an enhanced spectrum of activity that includes Candida species , Aspergillus species , Cryptococcus species , dimorphic fungi , Fusarium species , and , for posaconazole , Zygomycetes . Recent data suggest that these agents are highly effective in a variety of clinical settings . Echinocandins have good activity against Candida species and Aspergillus species but their spectrum generally does not include Fusarium species , Cryptococcus species , Trichosporon species , Zygomycetes , and dematiaceous moulds . While these agents are unlikely to exhibit crossresistance with polyenes or azoles , they must be administered intravenously . Knowledge of the pathogenesis of IFIs and the activity , efficacy , and limitations of available treatment options will allow the selection of an appropriate antifungal agent for individual patients .","Infection Aspergillus to Zygomycetes : causes , risk factors , prevention , and treatment of invasive fungal infections .
